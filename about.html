            <p>Ryan Arthur Walker is a PE teacher who currently works in Shanghai, China at Shanghai High School International Division. Ryan has far too many hobbies. From video games, to music, to drones, to making videos and more, coding has somehow found its way into the mix. Thanks to ChatGPT for being a private tutor, Ryan created a webpage to make creating a diagram of a game/lesson easier.</p>

            <p>As a graduate of SUNY Cortland '14 and now a 10-year veteran of teaching PE, Ryan's brain is constantly thinking of new games to play and how they would work. There is a folder in Ryan's desk called "games and stuff" that is filled with hundreds of folded pieces of paper that have notes from various games and modifications Ryan has made or learned over the years. This webpage is designed to be the digital equivalent of that folder. With an easy-to-use export function and minimal interface, you will be able to complete ideas quickly and have a digital copy that is shareable or printable in a matter of minutes.</p>
